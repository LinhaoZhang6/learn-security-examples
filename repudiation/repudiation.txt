- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The insecure code allows anyone to access messages without authentication, opening the door to
repudiation. The secure version requires authentication before accessing messages, making it harder
to deny actions.

Additional security measures include robust authentication, access control, message integrity
checks, audit logging, and error handling to prevent such attacks.
