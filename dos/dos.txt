- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability in the insecure code stems from directly using user-provided values in the query,
exposing it to NoSQL injection attacks. The secure version mitigates this by using a try-catch block
to handle errors, preventing attackers from crafting malicious queries.

To prevent such attacks, additional security measures include input validation, parameterized
queries, output encoding, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and logging.
