Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability in the insecure code lies in its susceptibility to NoSQL injection attacks due to
lack of input validation and sanitation. The secure code mitigates this by validating and sanitizing
user input. It checks if the username parameter is a string and sanitizes it by removing
non-alphanumeric characters before querying the database. This prevents attackers from manipulating
the input to perform malicious queries. Tampering violates the integrity CIA property. Additional
security measures include authentication, encryption, rate limiting, logging, parameterized queries,
and input validation to enhance overall security.
