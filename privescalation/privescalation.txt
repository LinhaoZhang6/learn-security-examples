The insecure code lacks proper authentication and authorization, allowing any user to update roles,
which poses a privilege escalation risk. The secure version implements session-based authentication
to ensure users are logged in and have admin privileges before allowing role updates.

Additional security measures to prevent such attacks include role-based access control, input
validation, robust error handling, HTTPS usage, content security policy, and CSRF protection. These
measures enhance overall security and protect against various types of attacks.
